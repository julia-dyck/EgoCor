\title{Spatially correlated birthweight data with artificial coordinates}
\format{
A data frame with 903 rows and 8 variables:
\describe{
  \item{x}{x-coordinate given in Cartesian format in meters,}
  \item{y}{y-coordinate given in Cartesian format in meters,}
  \item{birthweight}{weight of the child in gram,}
  \item{primiparous}{binary: 1 = first child birth, 0 = not the first child birth,}
  \item{datediff}{difference between due date and birth,}
  \item{bmi}{BMI (body mass index) of the mother at the beginning of pregnancy,}
  \item{weight}{weight of the mother in kg,}
  \item{inc}{income quintiles 0 (low), 1, 2, 3, 4 (high).}
}
}
\usage{
birth
}
\description{
A simulated dataset containing geo-coded birthweight data with covariates.
It is provided for exemplary applications of the functions
within the EgoCor package.
}
\details{
The dataset is loosely based on the BaBi study dataset
 referred to in \insertCite{BaBi;textual}{EgoCor}. The spatial correlation structure
 was already modeled using an exponential model in \insertCite{sauzet2021;textual}{EgoCor}.
